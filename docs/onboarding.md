# GoPad Onboarding and Help

## First-Run Checklist

1. Open your project.
- Click `Open Folder` (native picker) or paste a path and click `Open Path`.
- Confirm the project card shows module detection and run targets.

2. Run your first snippet.
- Write code in the editor and press `Run (Cmd+Enter)`.
- Output appears in split `Stdout` and `Stderr` panels.

3. Cancel and rerun.
- While running, click `Cancel` to stop execution.
- Click `Re-run Last` to execute the previous snippet again.

4. Save snippet to library.
- In `Snippet Library`, enter a name and click `Save`.
- Use search, rename, duplicate, and delete for snippet management.

## Configuration Tips

- `Format (gofmt)` normalizes code before execution.
- Set project-specific working directory in the project card.
- Choose a Go toolchain from detected binaries and save it per project.
- Manage environment variables in `Environment Variables`; mask sensitive values.

## Help Access in App

- Use the `Help` button in the top toolbar.
- The in-app help card provides a first-run checklist and quick tips.
